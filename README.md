# A Sandbox for Judger

## Brief Introduction

This is a simple sandbox developed for an online judge platform which I developed together with others [zhuqinggang][https://coding.net/u/zhuqinggang].The sandbox is based on maybe an ancient one, and I fixed some bugs and tested it, in order to get it running on my computer.

This sandbox and its runner are still under development. If you are interested in developing an online judge, comments and issues are greatly appreciated.

这个小项目是基于一个别人写的古老的沙箱写的。原项目[Eevee][https://github.com/Hexcles/Eevee] 。我修了几个巨大的bug然后稍加改进就写了这个东西。
